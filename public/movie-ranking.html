<h3>Kung Fu Panda</h3>
<p>
    We love this movie, purely because the main character is a fat ass panda, who can do amazing kicks!<br />
    He is also known for his amazing eating skills, since he can slurp up a bowl of noodles whenever he wants.<br />
    Wel love him very, very much!

<h3>Kung Fu Panda 2</h3>
<p>
    This is the second movie of the trilogy, which brightened our hearts up even more!<br /> 
    The bird was weird and creepy tho.<br />

<h3>Kung Fu Panda 3</h3>
<p>
    This movie was so lovely, because our dear friend Po reunited with his family, who then became our family.<br /> 
    We loved it.
